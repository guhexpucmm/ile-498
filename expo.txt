1. What is a home a appliance?

A home appliance are electrical/mechanical machines which acomplish some household functions, such 
as cooling/healing, cooking or cleaning.
===================================================================================================
2. Why do we need it?

Home appliances makes our home lifes a lot easier by minimizing human effort.
===================================================================================================
3. Why do we used it for?

Home appliances can be used for lots of differents task such as:
    -Reheat food
    -Refrigerate food
    -Toast breads
    -Make quick coffee
===================================================================================================
4. While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered 
appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. 
The development of these appliances is tied the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and 
the desire to reduce the time consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. 
In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing machines, water heaters, 
refrigerators and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric clothes
iron in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Postâ€“World War II 
economic expansion, the domestic use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for 
convenience. Increasing discretionary income was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.
===================================================================================================
5. How they can be classified?

Home appliances can be classified into several categories:
    -Major appliances
    -Small appliances
    -Consumer electronics
===================================================================================================
6. Major appliances

Also know as white goods, comprise major household appliances and may include:
    -air conditioners
    -dishwashers
    -clothes dryers
    -drying cabinets
    -freezers
    -refrigerators
    -kitchen stoves
    -water heaters
    -washing machines
    -tash compactors,
    -Microwave ovens
    -Induction cookers

White goods were typically painted or enameled white, and many of them still are.
===================================================================================================
7. Small appliances

Small appliances are typically small household electrical machines,also very useful and easily 
carried and installed. Some are classified with white goods, and relate to heating and cooling 
such as:

    -fans
    -air conditioners
    -heaters
    -ceramic heaters
    -gas heaters
    -kerosene heaters
    -fan heaters
    -juicers
    -electric mixers
    -meat grinders
    -deep fryers
    -herb grinders
    -food processors
    -electric kettles
    -waffle irons
    -coffee makers
    -blenders
===================================================================================================
8. Consumer electronics

Also known as home electronics are electronic (analog or digital) equipments intended for 
everyday use, typically in private homes.

Consumer electronics include devices used for entertainment:
    -Flatscreens TVs
    -DVD Players
    -Video games
    -Remote control
    -Cars
    -phones
    -telephones
    -laptops
    -printers
    -desktop computers
    -paper shredders
===================================================================================================
9. Life span of appliances (In years)


===================================================================================================
10. Networking of home appliances

There is a trend of networking home appliances together, and combining their controls and key 
functions. For instance, energy distribution could be managed more evenly so that when a washing 
machine is on, an oven can go into a delayed start mode, or vice versa. Or, a washing machine and 
clothes dryer could share information about load characteristics (gentle/normal, light/full), and 
synchronize their finish times so the wet laundry does not have to wait before being put in the dryer.

Additionally, some manufacturers of home appliances are quickly beginning to place hardware that 
enables Internet connectivity in home appliances to allow for remote control, automation, 
communication with other home appliances, and more functionality. Internet-connected home 
appliances were especially prevalent during recent Consumer Electronic Show events.
===================================================================================================
11. Health technologies


===================================================================================================
12. What is it?

Health technology is defined by the World Health Organization as the "application of organized 
knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures and systems developed 
to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives".This includes the pharmaceuticals, 
devices, procedures and organizational systems used in health care.

Health technology refers to the application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of 
devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and 
improve quality of lives.
===================================================================================================
13. How technology is transforming health care

Digital innovations have now made it possible for consumers to use portable devices to access their 
medical information, monitor their vital signs, take tests at home and carry out a wide range of tasks. 
In his book "The Creative Destruction of Medicine," Eric Topol, a cardiologist, geneticist and researcher, 
describes how medicine is entering an age of democratization as power shifts from hospitals, doctors and 
other caregivers to patients, potentially leading to dramatic health care improvements.

In the mid-20th century Joseph Schumpeter, the noted Austrian economist, popularized the term 
"creative destruction" to denote transformation that accompanies radical innovation. In recent years, 
our world has been "Schumpetered."

By virtue of the intensive infiltration of digital devices into our daily lives, we have radically 
altered how we communicate with one another and with our entire social network at once. Everywhere we go, 
we take pictures and videos with our cellphone, the one precious object that never leaves our side. 
Forget about going to a video store to rent a movie and finding out it is not in stock. Just download it 
at home and watch it on television, a computer monitor, a tablet or even your phone. The Web lets us 
sample nearly all books in print without even making a purchase and efficiently download the whole book 
in a flash. Our lives have been radically transformed through digital innovation. Radically transformed. 
Creatively destroyed.

14. Ways that technology is changing health care


===================================================================================================
15. Better and More Accessible Treatment

A number of industry analysts have observed that increased accessibility of treatment is one of the 
most tangible ways that technology has changed healthcare. Health IT opens up many more avenues of 
exploration and research, which allows experts to make healthcare more driven and effective than it 
has ever been.
===================================================================================================
16. Improved Care and Efficiency

Another key area that has grown and continues to do so is patient care. The use of information 
technology has made patient care safer and more reliable in most applications.

The fact that nurses and doctors who are working on the frontline are now routinely using hand-held 
computers to record important real-time patient data and then sharing it instantly within their updated 
medical history is an excellent illustration of the benefits of health IT.

Being able to accumulate lab results, records of vital signs and other critical patient data into one 
centralized area has transformed the level of care and efficiency a patient can expect to receive when
they enter the healthcare system.

An increased level of efficiency in data collection means that a vast online resource of patient 
history is available to scientists, who are finding new ways to study trends and make medical 
breakthroughs at a faster rate.
===================================================================================================
17. Software Improves Healthcare and Disease Control

The development of specific software programs means that, for example, the World Health Organization 
has been able to classify illnesses, their causes and symptoms into a massive database that encompasses 
more than 14,000 individual codes.

This resource allows medical professionals and researchers to track, retrieve and utilize valuable data 
in the fight to control disease and provide better healthcare outcomes in general.

Software also plays a pivotal role in tracking procedures and using billing methods that not only 
reduce paperwork levels, but also allow practitioners to use this data to improve quality of care and 
all around efficiency.

Doctors report that they are deriving enormous benefits from the drive toward a total system of electronic 
medical records; patients enjoy the fact that software has created a greater degree of transparency in the 
healthcare system.

We have seen many positive changes in health IT and expect to continue witnessing more exciting developments
in the future!
===================================================================================================
18. The internet has become a main source of medical information

According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, in a 2004 survey of 8 million seniors who 
use the internet, only 66% said they searched healthcare information online. In 2009 24 million 
Americans reported the same.

It goes without saying that more and more people are using the Internet to research their medical 
issues. This means not only looking up symptoms, but exploring treatments and medicines on the web. 
While it is never a good idea to skip out on the doctor completely, the Internet has made patients 
more empowered to make decisions about what to do next.
===================================================================================================
19. Healthcare facilities are reaching patients using social media

It is easy to see how public clinics, doctor offices, and even research facilities can take advantage 
of social media tools to reach wider populations. And there is evidence that they are going above 
and beyond.

Healthcare facilities, particularly hospitals, are using social media to establish contact with 
patients, answer questions about practices, launch public awareness campaigns, and perform community 
outreach. Some sophisticated sites even offer instant chats with nurses and doctors about medical 
issues and reminders for people to get regularly needed tests and vaccines.

These projects have taken off on college campuses but are rapidly spreading to more mainstream 
institutions (Hey - even senior citizens are on Facebook now!). A detailed presentation on this 
trend can found here.
===================================================================================================
20. Better treatment and less suffering

Let's not forget the most obvious way technology has changed healthcare: by providing new machines,
medicines, and treatments that save lives and improve the chance of recovery for billions.

Not only do sophisticated medical practices help patients heal directly; new technology has also 
improved research so experts can make healthcare even more effective.

This moving story of how new technology changed the life of someone who suffered from chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease is only one example of how lives are being changed in practical, 
every-day terms.
===================================================================================================
21. Onlie database can accurately predict medical trends

By analyzing health information that users search for online, search engines such as Google have 
been able to accurately predict medical trends such as flu outbreaks.

Google explains its process on Google.org:

"Of course, not every person who searches for "flu" is actually sick, but a pattern emerges when all
the flu-related search queries are added together. We compared our query counts with traditional flu 
surveillance systems and found that many search queries tend to be popular exactly when flu season is 
happening. By counting how often we see these search queries, we can estimate how much flu is 
circulating in different countries and regions around the world."

This breakthrough will help medical experts respond to outbreaks quickly as well as take preventative 
measures. And as more and more people use the web to search for their own medical problems, these 
internet giants will have even more information to apply to scientific studies.
