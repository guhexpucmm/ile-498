5. While many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered 
appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. 
The development of these appliances is tied the disappearance of full-time domestic servants and 
the desire to reduce the time consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. 
In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included washing machines, water heaters, 
refrigerators and sewing machines. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric clothes
iron in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry. In the Postâ€“World War II 
economic expansion, the domestic use of dishwashers, and clothes dryers were part of a shift for 
convenience. Increasing discretionary income was reflected by a rise in miscellaneous home appliances.

10. Networking of home appliances

There is a trend of networking home appliances together, and combining their controls and key 
functions. For instance, energy distribution could be managed more evenly so that when a washing 
machine is on, an oven can go into a delayed start mode, or vice versa. Or, a washing machine and 
clothes dryer could share information about load characteristics (gentle/normal, light/full), and 
synchronize their finish times so the wet laundry does not have to wait before being put in the dryer.

Additionally, some manufacturers of home appliances are quickly beginning to place hardware that 
enables Internet connectivity in home appliances to allow for remote control, automation, 
communication with other home appliances, and more functionality. Internet-connected home 
appliances were especially prevalent during recent Consumer Electronic Show events.
